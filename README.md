# Helping Hands
A website that allows elderly, immuno-compromised, or other vulnerable groups
for help from other members of their community. Our platform allows individuals
to create posts requesting for help with errands, such as groceries. Then, healthy
volunteers in their local community would be able to see these posts and reach out to help.
